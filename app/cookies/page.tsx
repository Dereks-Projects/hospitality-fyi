              This Cookie Policy explains how HOSPITALITY.FYI uses cookies and similar tracking technologies when you

            </p>

            <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
            <p>
              Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device (computer, smartphone, or tablet) when 
              you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and provide 
              information to website owners. Cookies can be "persistent" (remaining on your device until deleted 
              or expired) or "session" (deleted when you close your browser).
            </p>

            <h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
            <p>
              We use cookies to enhance your experience on our website, understand how you interact with our content, 
              and improve our services. Specifically, we use cookies to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Remember your preferences and settings</li>
              <li>Understand which pages and features are most popular</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
            
            <h3>Essential Cookies</h3>
            <p>
              These cookies are necessary for our website to function properly. They enable core functionality 
              such as security, network management, and accessibility. These cookies do not store any personally 
              identifiable information and cannot be disabled in our systems.
            </p>

            <h3>Analytics Cookies</h3>
            <p>
              We use Google Analytics to collect information about how visitors use our website. These cookies 
              collect information in an anonymous form, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Number of visitors to the site</li>
              <li>Pages visited during a session</li>
              <li>Time spent on each page</li>
              <li>How visitors arrived at the site (referral sources)</li>
              <li>General geographic location (city/country level)</li>
              <li>Device and browser information</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This information helps us understand how our website is being used and how we can improve it. 
              Google Analytics does not collect personally identifiable information, and we do not combine 
              analytics data with any other data sources to identify individual users.
            </p>

            <h3>Functionality Cookies</h3>
            <p>
              These cookies allow our website to remember choices you make (such as your language preferences 
              or region) and provide enhanced, more personalized features. They may also be used to provide 
              services you have requested.
            </p>

            <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>
            <p>It's important to us that you understand what we don't do with cookies:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>We do not sell your data:</strong> We never sell, rent, or trade any data collected through cookies to third parties</li>
              <li><strong>We do not harvest data for advertising:</strong> We do not use cookies to build advertising profiles or target you with ads</li>
              <li><strong>We do not track across websites:</strong> We do not use cookies to track your browsing activity on other websites</li>
              <li><strong>We do not share with data brokers:</strong> We do not share cookie data with data aggregation companies or marketing databases</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Google Analytics Specifically</h2>
            <p>
              Google Analytics is the only third-party analytics service we use. Google Analytics uses cookies 
              to help us understand website traffic and usage patterns. The information generated by the cookie 
              about your use of the website (including your IP address) is transmitted to and stored by Google 
              on servers in the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
              Google uses this information to evaluate your use of the website, compile reports on website 
              activity for website operators, and provide other services relating to website activity and 
              internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do 
              so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can opt out of Google Analytics by installing the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>, 
              which prevents your data from being used by Google Analytics.
            </p>

            <h2>Managing Your Cookie Preferences</h2>
            
            <h3>Browser Settings</h3>
            <p>
              Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings. You can set your browser to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Block all cookies</li>
              <li>Accept only first-party cookies (from the website you're visiting)</li>
              <li>Prompt you before accepting cookies</li>
              <li>Delete cookies after each browsing session</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Please note that blocking all cookies may impact your ability to use certain features of our website. 
              Essential cookies are necessary for the website to function, while blocking analytics cookies will 
              not affect your browsing experience but will limit our ability to improve the site.
            </p>

            <h3>Browser-Specific Instructions</h3>
            <p>For detailed information on managing cookies in specific browsers:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Chrome</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla Firefox</a></li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Mobile Device Settings</h2>
            <p>
              Mobile devices also allow you to control cookies and tracking through privacy settings. Consult 
              your device manufacturer's instructions for specific guidance on managing cookies on mobile devices.
            </p>

            <h2>Do Not Track Signals</h2>
            <p>
              Some browsers include a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that signals to websites that you do not want 
              your online activity tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret 
              DNT signals, our website does not currently respond to DNT browser signals. We continue to monitor 
              developments in DNT technology and may implement DNT recognition in the future.
            </p>

            <h2>Changes to This Cookie Policy</h2>
            <p>
              We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes in technology, legislation, 
              or our business practices. When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top 
              of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we 
              use cookies.
            </p>
